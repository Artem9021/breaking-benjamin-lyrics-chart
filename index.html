Shove me under you again
I can't wait for this to end
Sober, empty in the head
I know I can never win
Why should I have to wait?
I'll just look the other way

We left this land of shiny lights
I wish I may, I wish I might
When all these dreams have come to end
You wish you were, you're not my friend

I can see you suffocate
I can find no other way
Try to make you saturate
I can be your enemy
Why should I have to wait?
I'll just look the other way

We left this land of shiny lights
I wish I may, I wish I might
When all these dreams have come to end
You wish you were, you're not my friend

Woah no

We left this land of shiny lights
I wish I may, I wish I might
When all these dreams have come to end
You wish you were, you're not my friend

You said you'd love
To see the end
The long hard road
That I have been
When all these dreams have come to end
You wish you were, you're not my friend
Blind eyes shine bright

I got somethin' up my sleeve
I know you will cover me
Inside out and in between
I know you will cover me
I've got bruises on my knees
I know you will cover me
Inside out and in between
And I know you will cover me

[Chorus:]
Run away
Make hate
And get laid
And get laid
You tie me up
I've had enough
So medicate
Medicate

I'm already incomplete
I know you will cover me
Looking by your empathy
I know you will cover me
I've been lyin' here for weeks
I know you will cover me
Inside out and in between
And I know you will cover me


Let's go

The day has come to an end
The sun is over my head
My polyamorous friend
He got me in a mess of trouble again

So
Just when you think that you're all right
I'm calling out from the inside
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all

They've come to get me again
The cloud is over my head
My polyamorous friend
He got me in a mess of trouble again

So
Just when you think that you're all right
I'm calling out from the inside
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all

Just stay away from the white light
I'd say your worst side's your best side
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all

Well how do you know?
Well how do you know?
Well how do you know?
Well how do you know?

Just when you think that you're all right
I'm calling out from the inside
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all

Just stay away from the white light
I'd say your worst side's your best side
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all
Let's go 

Well I know you don't know the reason
And it's cold, a sign of the season
'Cause you're old, and battered and beaten
And we'll grow, til we hit the ceiling, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I'll be better, get away
Send a letter, bombs away

[Chorus:]
You're covered in my skin
I couldn't imagine anyone else
I'm off for the weekend
I couldn't imagine why you would save yourself

Well it's gone and it's not returning
And your clothes and pictures are burning
'Cause you're old, and battered and beaten
And we'll grow, til we hit the ceiling, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

I couldn't imagine
Why you would save yourself 


hold still
all of my life
all of my time
I don't wanna come back around tonight
and all that I need
is serenity
I don't wanna feel your new disease

[chorus:]
the natural life
you're born, you die
the natural life
you're wrong, you're right
the natural life
you're born, you die
the natural life's a lie

all of my lies
swallow your pride
I don't wanna come back around tonight
and all that I need
is serenity
I don't wanna feel your new disease

[chorus]

right
you're right
I can never lie
let me go
try to find a home
I can't wait
try to stay awake
dead inside
bothered by the lie
you're right

Beneath this wave
I just can't take your breath away

You cut me down
You know I'll always be around
So now I wait
I know you'll live another day

Come and take my breath away
But look me straight in the face

'Cause you know it's over
Growin' colder
I need something
Leave me next to nothing
All we ever wanted
I need something
Leave me next to nothing
Next to nothing

I cut you down
I know you'll always be around
So now you'll wait
I know you'll live another day

Come and take my breath away
But look me straight in the face

'Cause you know it's over
Growin' colder
I need something
Leave me next to nothing
All we ever wanted
I need something
Leave me next to nothing
Next to nothing
Next to nothing
Next to nothing
Next to nothing

'Cause you know it's over
Growin' colder
I need something
Leave me next to nothing
All we ever wanted
I need something
Leave me next to nothing
Next to nothing



what's all this talk of a notion?
I'd rather drink from the ocean
what did you mean when you said no?
I only want what is best for you
but I won't ever let you drown
no I won't ever let you down
[chorus]
cause I am my enemy
the water's up to the knee
I never wanted nothin' from you
yes I do, yes I do
my engine's runnin' on dry
my head's so fucked up inside
shut up
I know
I said so
there is no way to recover
you told me there is no other
the surface is getting hotter
I'll shove your head under water
but I won't ever let you drown
no I won't ever let you down

I've got a little red bow
And I bought it for you
'Cause I know you're not fair
I don't get it, oh well

And you color my skin
And the colors don't blend
'Cause I'm gonna get you
And your little dog too

There's a yellow brick road
That we follow back home
'Cause I know you can't wait
Your belligerent hate

There's no place like home
There's no place like
Home
Like
Home

I've, got a Southern belle too
And ruby red shoes
With a body of straw
Are you sick of it all?

There's a man made of tin
With an oil can grin
And I'm gonna get you
And your little dog too

There's a yellow brick road
That we follow back home
And I know you can't wait
Your belligerent hate
There's no place like home
There's no place like home

There's a little white porch
And you wanted it so
Can you let me go down
To the end of the road
In the black and the white
A Technicolorful life
Can I stand by your side?
We can make it alright

Like home
'Cause I'm home

There's a little white porch
And you wanted it so
Can you let me go down
To the end of the road
In the black and the white
A Technicolorful life
Then another arrived
It's a cowardly lion

What I want from this world
What I wanna resolve
When I want you to stay
So I want you to wait
I don't wanna be bold
I don't wanna be cold
I don't wanna grow old
I wanna go home! 



The light is dead in your eye
So I'll keep living my life
I only wanted to try
To find my way back inside
My imitation of life
My litigation of life
It's something easy to find
Inside the shade of your eye

[Chorus]
Out of the ground I rise to grace
Nobody knows it's just a phase
Help me I'm out of breath again
Nobody knows somewhere to make it go away

Phase [x4]
I find it hard to decide
The way to make up your mind
Your lips are better than mine
So you can kiss this goodbye
My imitation of life
My litigation of life
It's something easy to find
Inside the shade of your eye

[Chorus]
It's just a phase
And I can't wait
Phase [x3]
I know [x3]
It's just a fucking phase

It's just a fucking phase
I'm drained time to fake and delay
Watch the penny drop
Let it go up and in drop
Then watch it roll
Let's all mourn till
I survive inside you

This game is over
I'm mean and older
You're coming closer
Over and over

My dear Rhiannon
I need an answer
What was the question?
I can't remember

Would you want to feel the way that I do?
And I bend to your will
I've fellated myself

Tied to the needle
My drunk libido
My nervous ego
The faster we go
You are an asshole
King of the castle
I am the meager
Follow the leader

Would you want to feel the way that I do?
And I bend, to your will
I've fellated myself

And I know that you don't like the way that it goes
We're all in
So begin
Just remember: I win

Would you want to feel the way that I do?
And I bend to your will
I've fellated myself

And I know that you don't like the way that it goes
We're all in
So begin
Just remember: I win

That I win!
That I win!
That I win!
That I win!

That I win!
That I win!
That I win!
That I win! 


It started again
Claiming a friend
I couldn't be
I've never been
I'm all alone
Out in the cold
I'll never know
Your sugarcoat
You're ready to blow
You're ready to go
But I'll never know
Your sugarcoat
Is just as sweet as I am

Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red
What did you say
Willing to drown in a tidal wave
Take me away
Let me believe that you're on your way
Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red

I'm on the floor
Battered and bored
You got a taste
I can't ignore
I'm all alone
Out in the cold
I'll never know
Your sugarcoat
You're ready to blow
You're ready to go
But I'll never know
Your sugarcoat
Is just as sweet as I am

Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red
What did you say
Willing to drown in a tidal wave
Take me away
Let me believe that you're on your way
Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red

Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red
What did you say
Willing to drown in a tidal wave
Take me away
Let me believe that you're on your way
Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red

Red
Your eyes are red



come on
the sun will rise
another time
the colors blind
your virgin eyes
I'm so inclined
to make you mine
you're out of line
and out of time
[chorus]
and I float upon a shallow bay
lift me up until the ground gives way
I'm a California castaway
I don't think you wanna fuck with me
don't over kill
this painless thrill
it's bitter still
your pretty pill
you wait until
you've had your fill
I know you will
I know you will
[chorus]
a shallow bay
a shallow bay
[chorus x 2]
you live, you learn
you live, you learn
you live, you learn
you live

Do you know
I can never leave you?
And no
I can never beat you?

And if I,
I could never find you,
Never mind,
I will not forget you.

Can I stay alive forever?
Can I stay alive forever?
Can I stay alive forever?
Forever.

Can you feel a chemical reaction?
'Cause I feel a hideous attraction?
And could we share a poison apple? 
Can it be maniacal and awful?

Can I stay alive forever?
Can I stay alive forever?
Can I stay alive forever?
Forever. Forever

Stay alive forever
Forever
Stay alive forever
Stay alive forever
Stay alive forever
Stay alive forever
Stay alive forever



Crowded streets are cleared away
One by one
Hollow heroes separate
As they run

You're so cold
Keep your hand in mine
Wise men wonder while strong men die

Show me how it ends it's alright
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well, that's alright, let's give this another try

If you find no family, don't you cry
In this land of make-believe, dead and dry

You're so cold, but you feel alive
Lay your hand on me one last time

Show me how it ends it's alright
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well, that's alright, let's give this another try

Show me how it ends it's alright
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well, that's alright, let's give this another try

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright


I live a chemical life
I'm on a mission to try
You went insane for a day
I'll have to shove it away
My only option is gone
Smile as they break and they fall
You want a simpler life
You can't erase what was mine

[Pre-Chorus:]
You must be out of your mind!
This was a simple design!
You fuck it up everytime
How could you leave me behind

[Chorus:]
It's alright, it's alright
'cause I know what you want
but you'll just have to wait
If I had it to give
I would give it away
I'm living it up
while I'm falling from grace
There's no way, there's no way that I'm running away

I'm used to making it worse
Made up of four letter words
You wanna know what it was
Now isolated and gone
You fall apart at the seams
I'll never know what it means
Try not to pull it apart
You're aiming straight from the heart

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

It had to be the worst for me
I don't know what to say so let me be
And now I find you left me behind
I don't know what to say so nevermind!

You're mine!

[Chorus]
I'm losing sight
Don't count on me
I chase the sun
It chases me

You know my name
You know my face
You'd know my heart
If you knew my place
I'll walk straight down
As far as I can go!

I'll follow you, you follow me
I don't know why you lie so clean
I'll break right through the irony

Enlighten me
Reveal my fate
Just cut these strings
That hold me safe

You know my head
You know my gaze
You'd know my heart
If you knew your place
I'll walk straight down
As far as I can go

I'll follow you, you follow me
I don't know why you lie so clean
I'll break right through the irony

Cure this wait
I hate this wait
I hate this wait

I'll follow you, you follow me
I don't know why you lie so clean
I'll break right through the irony
I don't know why

I'll follow you, you follow me
I don't know why you lie so clean
I'll break right through the irony

You my friend
You're a lot like them
But I caught your lie
And you know I did
Now I'm lost in you
Like I always do
And I'd die to win
'Cause I'm born to lose

Firefly
Could you shine your light
Now I know your ways
'Cause they're just like mine
Now I'm justified
As I fall in line
And it's hard to try
When you're open wide

Take my hand
We'll be off and then
We'll come back again
To a different land
Now I like this way
You can go away
If you guess the name
You cannot replace

Firefly
Could you shine your light
Now I know your ways
'Cause they're just like mine
Now I'm justified
As I fall in line
And it's hard to try
When you're open wide

Bring me your enemies
Lay them before me
And walk away
Walk away
Walk away

Firefly
Could you shine your light
Now I know your ways
'Cause they're just like mine
Now I'm justified
As I fall in line
And it's hard to try
When you're open wide

Fucking firefly
Have you lost your light
Now I hate your ways
'Cause they're just like mine
So you lost my friend
Such a sorry end
And I don't know why
So I joke and smile

Smile



You fought me once but not again
You let me feel your heavy hand
I will clean your fucking mess
And leave no trace of evidence

[Chorus:]
I am losing you again
Let me out and let me in
'cause you're not alone here
Not at all
Let me belong here
Break my fall

Shelter me from this again
Dedicated to the end
Help me break my conscience in
To free us from our innocence

[Chorus]

"Mayday, Mayday.
Requesting permission to land.
I cannot control the plane.
We are in danger of crashing"

[Chorus]

[x5]
Break my fall




It's a crime you let it happen to me
Nevermind, I'll let it happen to you
Out of mind, forget it there's nothing to lose
But my mind and all the things I wanted

Every time I get it I throw it away
It's a sign, I get it, I wanna stay
By the time I lose it I'm not afraid
I'm alive but I can surely fake it

How can I believe when this cloud hangs over me
You're the part of me that I don't wanna see

Forget it

There's a place I see you follow me
Just a taste of all that might come to be
I'm alone but holding breath you can breathe
To question every answer counted

Just fade away
Please let me stay
Caught in your way

Forget it

Just fade away
Please let me stay
Caught in your way

It's a crime you let it happen to me
Out of mind, I love it, easy to please
Nevermind, forget it, just memories
On a page inside a spiral notebook

Just fade away
Please let me stay
Caught in your way
I can live forever here

Just fade away
Please let me stay
Caught in your way
I can live forever

Forget it

How can I believe when this cloud hangs over me
You're a part of me that I don't wanna see

Forget it, forget it

I can live forever here





I want a normal life
just like a new born child
I am a lover hater
I am an instigator
You are an oversight
Don't try to compromise
I'll learn to love to hate it
I am not integrated

[Pre-Chorus]
Just call my name
You'll be okay
Your scream is burning through my veins

Sooner or later you're gonna hate it
Go ahead and throw your life away
Driving me under, leaving me out there
Go ahead and throw your life away

You're like an infantile
I knew it all the while
You sit and try to play me
Just like you see on tv
I am an oversight
Just like a parasite
Why am I so pathetic
I know you won't forget it

[Pre-chorus]

Sooner or later you're gonna hate it
Go ahead and throw my life away
Driving me under, leaving me out there
Go ahead and throw my life away

Sooner or later you're gonna hate it
Go ahead and throw our life away
Driving me under, leaving me out there
Go ahead and throw our life away

Throw our life away
Ooooo
Throw our life away



Breakdown!

Let the fun and games begin
She is spayed and broken in
Skin is cold and white
Such a lovely lonely night

[Pre-chorus]
Heaven is on the way
You could feel the hate
but I guess you never will
I'm on a roll again
and I want an end
'cause I feel you creeping in

[Chorus:]
What I found in this town
I'm heading for a breakdown
What's that sound, you're so loud
I'm heading for a breakdown

Drank up all my alcohol
This is not a free for all
I'll be there for you
'Til my heart is black and blue

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus x2]

You breakdown, you're so proud.
I'm heading for a breakdown.
What's that sound, it's so loud.
I'm heading for a breakdown.
No!

Cold am I
I'm beside myself
Because there's no one else
Have I grown
So blind
Only god could save you
If you knew your way to the light
So fly away
And leave it behind
Just stay awake
There's nowhere to hide

I see you
Cause you won't get out of my way
I hear you
Cause you won't quit screaming my name
I feel you
Cause you won't stop touching my skin
I need you
They're coming to take you away

Frail and dry
I could lose it all
But I cannot recall
It's all wrong
Don't cry
Clear away this hate
And we can start to make it alright
So fly away
And leave it behind
Return someday
With red in your eyes

I see you
Cause you won't get out of my way
I hear you
Cause you won't quit screaming my name
I feel you
Cause you won't stop touching my skin
I need you
They're coming to take you away

I see you
Cause you won't get out of my way
I hear you
Cause you won't quit screaming my name
I feel you
Cause you won't stop touching my skin
I need you
They're coming to take you away




Don't tread the water
Just stay still
I'll not be bothered
By you until
I'm picking sides
And pulling the strings
I'm living lies
And shedding the skin
I'm open wide
And letting you in
I'm wronging rights

Believe
I don't care what you want
I just want mine
Shut up
Smart little bitch
I don't need lies
I don't care what you want
I just want mine
Get up
Force it to fit
Confined inside

Don't pull me under
Into the deep
I often wonder
How it should be
I'm picking sides
And pulling the strings
I'm living lies
And shedding the skin
I'm open wide
And letting you in
I'm wronging rights

Believe
I don't care what you want
I just want mine
Shut up
Smart little bitch
I don't need lies
I don't care what you want
I just want mine
Get up
Force it to fit
Confined inside

I don't care what you want
I just want mine
I don't care what you want
I just want mine
Shut up
Smart little bitch
I don't need lies
I don't care what you want
I just want mine
Get up
Force it to fit
Confined inside
My dead eyes

Take a photograph,
It'll be the last,
Not a dollar or a crowd could ever keep me here,

I don't have a past
I just have a chance,
Not a family or honest plea remains to say,

Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.

Is it you I want or just the notion
Of a heart to wrap around so I can find my way around?

Safe to say from here,
You're getting closer now,
We are never sad 'cause we are not allowed to be

Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.

Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.

To lie here under you,
Is all that I could ever do,
To lie here under you is all,
To lie here under you is all that i could ever do,
To lie here under you is all,

Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun.

Rain, rain go away,
Come again another day,
All the world is waiting for the sun,
All the world is waiting for the sun,
All the world is waiting for the sun.


If I had to
I would put myself right beside you
So let me ask
Would you like that?
Would you like that?

And I don't mind
If you say this love is the last time
So now I'll ask
Do you like that?
Do you like that?

No!

Something's getting in the way.
Something's just about to break.
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane.
So tell me how it should be.

Try to find out what makes you tick.
As I lie down
Sore and sick.
Do you like that?
Do you like that?

There's a fine line between love and hate.
And I don't mind.
Just let me say that
I like that
I like that

Something's getting in the way.
Something's just about to break.
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane.
As I burn another page,
As I look the other way.
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane.
So tell me how it should be.

Desperate, I will crawl
Waiting for so long
No love, there is no love.
Die for anyone
What have I become?

Something's getting in the way.
Something's just about to break.
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane.
As I burn another page,
As I look the other way.
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane.


I see nothing in your eyes,
And the more I see the less I like.

Is it over yet, in my head?

I know nothing of your kind,
And I won't reveal your evil mind.

Is it over yet? I can't win.

So sacrifice yourself, and let me have what's left.
I know that I can find the fire in your eyes.
I'm going all the way, get away, please.

You take the breath right out of me.
You left a hole where my heart should be.
You got to fight just to make it through,
'Cause I will be the death of you.

This will be all over soon.
Pour the salt into the open wound.

Is it over yet? Let me in.

So sacrifice yourself, and let me have what's left.
I know that I can find the fire in your eyes.
I'm going all the way, get away, please.

You take the breath right out of me.
You left a hole where my heart should be.
You got to fight just to make it through,
'Cause I will be the death of you.

I'm waiting, I'm praying, realize, start hating.

You take the breath right out of me.
You left a hole where my heart should be.
You got to fight just to make it through,
'Cause I will be the death of you.


My hands are broken,
And time is going on and on, it goes forever (how long).
So I got high and lived all that life that I've taken all for granted.

[Chorus:]
Promise me you'll try
To leave it all behind,
'cause I've elected hell,
Lying to myself.
Why have I gone blind?
Live another life.

You. You.

The only way out
Is letting your guard down and never die forgotten (I know).
Forgive me, my love,
I stand here all alone, and I can see the bottom.

[Chorus]

You. You.
You. You.
You. You.


Hold it together, birds of a feather,
Nothing but lies and crooked wings.
I have the answer, spreading the cancer,
You are the faith inside me.

No, don't
Leave me to die here,
Help me survive here.
Alone, don't remember, remember.

[Chorus:]
Put me to sleep evil angel.
Open your wings evil angel.

A-ah.

I'm a believer,
Nothing could be worse,
All these imaginary friends.
Hiding betrayal,
Driving the nail,
Hoping to find a savior.

No, don't
Leave me to die here,
Help me survive here.
Alone, don't
Surrender, surrender.

[Chorus]

Oh.
Fly over me evil angel.
Why can't I breathe evil angel?

[Chorus]

Oh.
Fly over me evil angel.
Why can't I breathe evil angel?

So clever,
Whatever,
I'm done with these endeavors.
Alone I walk the winding way.
(Here I stay)
It's over,
No longer,
I feel it growing stronger.
I'll live to die another day,
Until I fade away.

[Chorus:]
Why give up, why give in?
It's not enough, it never is.
So I will go on until the end.
We've become desolate.
It's not enough, it never is.
But I will go on until the end.

Surround me,
It's easy
To fall apart completely.
I feel you creeping up again.
(In my head)
It's over,
No longer,
I feel it growing colder.
I knew this day would come to end,
So let this life begin.

[Chorus]

I've lost my way.
I've lost my way, but I will go on until the end.

Living is hard enough
Without you fucking up.

[Chorus]

I've lost my way.
I've lost my way, but I will go on until the end.

U-uh, u-uh

The final fight I'll win,
The final fight I'll win,
The final fight I'll win,
But I will go on until the end.



Here I stand, helpless and left for dead

Close your eyes, so many days go by
Easy to find what's wrong, harder to find what's right

I believe in you, I can show you that I can see right through all your empty lies

I won't stay long, in this world so wrong

Say goodbye, as we dance with the devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye, as we dance with the devil tonight

Trembling, crawling across my skin
Feeling your cold dead eyes, stealing the life of mine

I believe in you, I can show you that I can see right through all your empty lies

I won't last long, in this world so wrong

Say goodbye, as we dance with the devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye, as we dance with the devil tonight

Hold on. Hold on

Say goodbye, as we dance with the devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye, as we dance with the devil tonight

Hold on. Hold on

Goodbye


Fruit on the vine.
You've got yours,
And I've got mine.
Meat on your bones.
They won't know, they won't know.

[Chorus:]
I love your face, just get away.
I'm on my knees, fuck you, fuck me.

I'm on my way to feel you dislocate.
Safe in your space.
I'm open, wide open.

[Chorus]

Like me, like me, like me.

[Chorus]

Me, me, me.


Sing it for me,
I can't erase the stupid things I say.
You're better than me,
I struggle just to find a better way.

[Chorus:]
So here we are, fighting and trying to hide the scars.
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye.
The lonely road, the one that I should try to walk alone.
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye.

You wouldn't like me.
Keep moving on until forever ends.
Don't try to fight me.
The beauty queen has lost her crown again.

[Chorus]

...goodbye.

So why are you so eager to betray?
Pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up.
So why are you the one that walks away?
Pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up.

O-oh.

[Chorus]

Just take a breath and softly say goodbye.


Border line,
Dead inside.
I don't mind,
Falling to pieces.
Count me in, violent
Let's begin, feeding the sickness.
How do I simplify,
Dislocate - the enemy's on the way.

[Chorus:]
Show me what it's like
To dream in black and white,
So I can leave this world tonight.

Full of fear,
Ever clear.
I'll be here,
Fighting forever.
Curious,
Venomous,
You'll find me
Climbing to heaven.
Never mind,
Turn back time.
You'll be fine - I will get left behind.

[Chorus]

Holding on too tight.
Breathe the breath of life,
So I can leave this world behind.

It only hurts just once.
They're only broken bones.
Hide the hate inside.

Oh.

[Very quiet voice:]
So I can leave this world behind

[Chorus]

Holding on too tight.
Breathe the breath of life,
So I can leave this world behind.


Milk it for all it's worth.
Make sure you get there first.
The apple of your eye.
The rotten core inside.
We are all prisoners.
Things couldn't get much worse.
I've had it up to here, you know your end is near.

[Chorus:]
You had to have it all,
Well have you had enough?
You greedy little bastard,
You will get what you deserve.
When all is said and done,
I will be the one to leave you in your misery and hate what you've become.

Intoxicated eyes, no longer live that life.
You should have learned by now, I'll burn this whole world down.
I need some peace of mind, no fear of what's behind.
You think you've won this fight, you've only lost your mind.

[Chorus:]
You had to have it all,
Well have you had enough?
You greedy little bastard,
You will get what you deserve.
When all is said and done,
I will be the one to leave you in your misery and hate what you've become.

Hold me down (I will live again)
Pull me out (I will break it in)
Hold me down (better in the end)
Hold me down.

[Chorus:]
You had to have it all,
Well have you had enough?
You greedy little bastard,
You will get what you deserve.
When all is said and done,
I will be the one to leave you in your misery and hate what you've become.

Heaven help you.
Heaven help you.

You fight me, flat on my lonely face I fell.
Finding in the end I live well.
In light of the life that I have found,
It's coming down.

I don't know what isn't real,
But it's easy
To beat me.
(Suck it in)
Life is sink or swim.
Love is blinding, no surviving.

I don't know what I want to be yet.
But I can show that I need to see this.
No time for lies and empty fights.
I'm on your side.

Can we live a life of peace and happiness?
I don't think so.

No denying I am scared to lose the things I love.
I'm in control.

[Chorus:]
This is how, this is how it's going to end.
This is how, this is how it's going to end.
End

Everyone is waiting here for everyone.
Leave me alone.

[Chorus:]
This is how, this is how it's going to end.
This is how, this is how it's going to end.
This is how, this is how it's going to end.
(No)
This is how, this is how it's going to end.


I'm cold and broken
It's over I didn't want to see it come to this
I wonder if I will ever see your face again
And I know that I will find a way to shed my skin
It's simple I know that I will suffer in the end

Fast I fade away
It's almost over
Hold on
Slow I suffocate
I'm cold and broken
Alone

It's hopeless, the end will come and wash it all away
Forsaken, I live for those I lost along the way
And I can't remember how it all began to break
You suffer, I live to fight and die another day

Fast I fade away
It's almost over
Hold on
Slow I suffocate
I'm cold and broken
Alone

Fast I fade away
It's almost over
Hold on
Slow I suffocate
I'm cold and broken
Alone

I'm cold and broken


Fall

Now the dark begins to rise
Save your breath, it's far from over
Leave the lost and dead behind
Now's your chance to run for cover

I don't want to change the world
I just wanna leave it colder
Light the fuse and burn it up
Take the path that leads to nowhere

All is lost again
But I'm not giving in

I will not bow
I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall
I will not fade
I will take your breath away

Fall

Watch the end through dying eyes
Now the dark is taking over
Show me where forever dies
Take the fall and run to Heaven

All is lost again
But I'm not giving in

I will not bow
I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall
I will not fade
I will take your breath away

And I'll survive, paranoid
I have lost the will to change
And I am not proud, cold-blooded fake
I will shut the world away

Open your eyes!

I will not bow
I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall
I will not fade
I will take your breath away

And I'll survive; paranoid
I have lost the will to change
And I am not proud, cold-blooded fake
I will shut the world away

Fall!

A shadow of a man
I am nothing less
I am holding on, still holding on

And every now and then
Life begins again
I am holding on, still holding on

I'm not like you
Your faceless lies
Your weak dead heart
Your black dead eyes

I'll make it through, but not this time
Your hope is gone, and so is mine

Live, fight
Crawl back inside
Sick, blind
Love left behind

And I won't live your weak wicked lie
You pull me in. I'm one step behind

Show me where it hurts
And I will make it worse
Are you holding on? Keep holding on

Dilated eyes shine
For one last time
Are you holding on? Keep holding on

You're not like me
Your faceless lies
Your weak dead heart
Your black dead eyes

I'll break you in
And let this die
Your hope is gone
And so is mine

Live, fight
Crawl back inside
Sick, blind
Love left behind

And I won't live your weak wicked lie
You pull me in. I'm one step behind

I'm becoming a monster just like you
After it all you'll try to break me too
Falling forever, chasing dreams
I brought you to life so I can hear you scream

Live, fight
Crawl back inside
Sick, blind
Love left behind

And I won't live your weak wicked lie
You pull me in, I'm one step behind

I'm one step behind
I'm one step behind




Dead star shine
Light up the sky
I'm all out of breath
My walls are closing in
Days go by
Give me a sign
Come back to the end
The shepherd of the damned

I can feel you falling away

No longer the lost
No longer the same
And I can see you starting to break
I'll keep you alive
If you show me the way
Forever - and ever
the scars will remain
I'm falling apart
Leave me here forever in the dark

Daylight dies
Blackout the sky
Does anyone care?
Is anybody there?
Take this life
Empty inside
I'm already dead
I'll rise to fall again

I can feel you falling away

No longer the lost
No longer the same
And I can see you starting to break
I'll keep you alive
If you show me the way
Forever - and ever
the scars will remain
I'm falling apart
Leave me here forever in the dark

God help me I've come undone
Out of the light of the sun
God help me I've come undone
Out of the light of the sun

I can feel you falling away

No longer the lost
No longer the same
And I can see you starting to break
I'll keep you alive
If you show me the way
Forever - and ever
the scars will remain

Give me a sign
There's something buried in the words
Give me a sign
Your tears are adding to the flood
Just give me a sign
there's something buried in the words
Give me a sign
Your tears are adding to the flood
Just give me a sign
There's something buried in the words
Give me a sign
Your tears are adding to the flood

Forever - and ever
The scars will remain


Here I lie forever
Sorrow still remains
Will the water pull me down and wash it all away
Come and take me over
Welcome to the game
Will the current drag me down and carry me away
Suddenly the light begins to fade

Hopeless
I'm falling down
Filthy
I can't wake up
I cannot hold on
I will not let go
Worthless
It's over now
Guilty
There's no way out
I cannot hold on
I will not let go

Silent I go under
I am not afraid
I can see the daylight shine
And slowly drift away
Safe to say it's over
Sink into the grave
There is nothing left inside
But I am wide awake
I can hear the devil call my name

Hopeless
I'm falling down
Filthy
I can't wake up
I cannot hold on
I will not let go
Worthless
It's over now
Guilty
There's no way out
I cannot hold on
I will not let go

Hopeless
I'm falling down
Filthy
I can't wake up
I cannot hold on
I will not let go
Worthless
It's over now
Guilty
There's no way out
I cannot hold on
I will not let go

Hopeless
Hopeless


Take a breath
Hold it in
Start a fight
You won't win
Had enough
Let's begin
Nevermind
I don't care

All in all
You're no good
You don't cry
Like you should
Let it go
If you could
When love dies in the end

So I'll find what lies beneath
Your sick twisted smile
As I lie underneath
Your cold jaded eyes
Now you turn the tide on me
'Cause you're so unkind
I will always be here
For the rest of my life

Here we go
Does it hurt
Say goodbye
to this world
I will not
Be undone
Come to life
It gets worse

All in all
You're no good
You don't cry
Like you should
I'll be gone
when you fall
Your sad life
Says it all

So I'll find what lies beneath
Your sick twisted smile
As I lie underneath
Your cold jaded eyes
Now you turn the tide on me
'Cause you're so unkind
I will always be here
For the rest of my life

Don't carry me under
You're the devil in disguise
God sing for the hopeless
I'm the one you left behind

So I'll find what lies beneath
Your sick twisted smile
As I lie underneath
Your cold jaded eyes
Now you turn the tide on me
'Cause you're so unkind
I will always be here
For the rest of my life

White walls surround us
No light will touch your face again
Rain taps the window
As we sleep among the dead

Days go on forever
But I have not left your side
We can chase the dark together
If you go then so will I

There is nothing left of you
I can see it in your eyes
Sing the anthem of the angels
And say the last goodbye

Cold light above us
Hope fills the heart
And fades away
Skin white as winter
As the sky returns to grey

Days go on forever
But I have not left your side
We can chase the dark together
If you go then so will I

There is nothing left of you
I can see it in your eyes
Sing the anthem of the angels
And say the last goodbye
I keep holding onto you
But I can't bring you back to life
Sing the anthem of the angels
Then say the last goodbye

You're dead alive [4x]

There is nothing left of you
I can see it in your eyes
Sing the anthem of the angels
And say the last goodbye
I keep holding onto you
But I can't bring you back to life
Sing the anthem of the angels
And say the last goodbye
Sing the anthem of the angels
And say the last goodbye
Sing the anthem of the angels




I am done pretending
You have failed to find what's left
I will suck you dry again
Some are not worth saving
You are such a pretty mess
I will choke the life within

Now you want to take me down
As if I even care
I am the monster in your head
And I thought you'd learn by now
It seems you haven't yet
I am the venom in your skin
And now your life
Is broken

After the lights go out on you
After your worthless life is through
I will remember how you scream
I can't afford to care
I can't afford to care

I am suffocating
You have failed to pull me in
I will drag you down again
Life is unrelenting
Feeding lies into my head
I will feed the lies you live

Now you want to take me down
As if I even care
I am the monster in your head
And I thought you'd learn by now
It seems you haven't yet
I am the venom in your skin
And now your life
Is broken

After the lights go out on you
After your worthless life is through
I will remember how you scream
I can't afford to care
I can't afford to care

After the lights go out on you
After your worthless life is through
I will remember how you scream
I can't afford to care
I can't afford to care

I can't afford to care
I can't afford to care



I have nothing left to give
I have found the perfect end
You were made to make it hurt
Disappear into the dirt
Carry me to heaven's arms
Light the way and let me go
Take the time to take my breath
I will end where I began

And I will find the enemy within
Cause I can feel it crawl beneath my skin

Dear Agony
Just let go of me
Suffer slowly
Is this the way it's gotta be?
Dear Agony

Suddenly
The lights go out
Let forever
Drag me down
I will fight for one last breath
I will fight until the end

And I will find the enemy within
Cause I can feel it crawl beneath my skin

Dear Agony
Just let go of me
Suffer slowly
Is this the way it's gotta be?
Don't bury me
Faceless enemy
I'm so sorry
Is this the way it's gotta be?
Dear Agony

Leave me alone
God let me go
I'm blue and cold
Black sky will burn
Love pull me down
Hate lift me up
Just turn around
There's nothing left

Somewhere far beyond this world
I feel nothing anymore

Dear Agony
Just let go of me
Suffer slowly
Is this the way it's gotta be?
Don't bury me
Faceless enemy
I'm so sorry
Is this the way it's gotta be?
Dear Agony

I feel nothing anymore


Screaming on the inside
I am frail and withered
Cover up the wounds
That I can't hide
Walls that lie between us
The saint within the sinner
I have lost the nerve
But it's all right
Carry the wounded and shut your eyes
All will be forgiven
None will rise
Bury the fallen and lead the blind
I will find the lost
Dead inside

Into the nothing
Faded and weary
I won't leave and let you fall behind
Live for the dying
Heaven hear me
I know we can make it out alive

Leave me at the bottom
I am lost forever
Letters from the dead
Say goodbye
Sorrow falls upon us
This will be the last time
Days begin to end
But I'll get by
Follow the hopeless
And shut your eyes

All will be abandoned
None will shine
Gather the broken and leave this life
Lying in the earth
Side by side

Into the nothing
Faded and weary
I won't leave and let you fall behind
Live for the dying
Heaven hear me
I know we can make it out alive

I'll keep you inside
Where I lead you cannot follow
Straight into the light
As my breath grows still and shallow

Into the nothing
Faded and weary
I won't leave and let you fall behind
Live for the dying
Heaven hear me
I know we can make it out alive

Stay with me
You're all I have left
I know we can make it out alive
Stay with me
You're all I have left
I know we can make it out alive



Search for the answers I knew all along
I lost myself, we all fall down
Never the wiser of what I've become
Alone I stand, a broken man

All I have is one last chance
I won't turn my back on you
Take my hand, drag me down
If you fall then I will too
And I can't save what's left of you

Say something new
I have nothing left
I can't face the dark without you
There's nothing left to lose
The fighting never ends
I can't face the dark without you

Swallow me under and pull me apart
I understand, there's nothing left
Pain so familiar and close to the heart
No more, no last, I won't forget

Come back down, save yourself
I can't find my way to you
And I can't bare and face the truth

Say something new
I have nothing left
I can't face the dark without you
There's nothing left to lose
The fighting never ends
I can't face the dark without you

I wanted to forgive
I'm trying to forget
Don't leave me here again
I am with you forever, the end

Say something new
I have nothing left
I can't face the dark without you
There's nothing left to lose
The fighting never ends
I can't face the dark without you

Holding the hand that holds me down
I forgive you, forget you, the end
Holding the hand that holds me down
I forgive you, forget you, the end

Life will come our way
It has only just begun
The world will die alone
The frail will fall below

Time will take our place
We return it back to one
The calm before the cold
The long and lonely road

Look for the light that leads me home

Tired of feeling lost, tired of letting go
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down
Failure

Drive the cloud away
We will fall from last to none
The dark before the dawn
The world will carry on

Look for the light that leads me home

Tired of feeling lost, tired of letting go
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down
Tired of wasted breath, tired of nothing left
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down
Failure

Tired of feeling lost, tired of letting go
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down
Tired of wasted breath, tired of nothing left
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down

We bury the sunlight, we bury the sunlight
Failure! Failure
We bury the sunlight, we bury the sunlight
Failure! Failure

Failure

I try to face the fight within
But it's over
I'm ready for the riot to begin
And surrender
I walked the path that led me to the end
Remember
I'm caught beneath with nothing left to give
Forever

When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever, forever

Grey skies will chase the light away
No longer
I fought the fight now only dark remains
Forever
Divided I will stand
And I will let this end

When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever, forever

The sun begins to rise
And wash away the sky
The turning of the tide
Don't leave it all behind
And I will never say goodbye

When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever, forever
Forever, forever



I'll keep my sights on awaking dream
I gave my life to the vile beneath
I am but one of a dying breed
Hate kills this world, but it won't kill me

(Wake up the victim of violence, shut the breath of the lifeless)
I'm breaking the silence I'm falling apart for you
(Wake up the victim of violence, shut the breath of the lifeless)
I'm chasing the righteous becoming a part of you

Fake plastic life, full of wasted years
Love lost inside, diabolic fear
I feel no fault for the fault I feel
Hope drains this world, but it won't drain me

(Wake up the victim of violence, shut the breath of the lifeless)
I'm breaking the silence I'm falling apart for you
(Wake up the victim of violence, shut the breath of the lifeless)
I'm chasing the righteous becoming a part of you

Run

(Wake up the victim of violence, shut the breath of the lifeless)
I'm breaking the silence I'm falling apart for you
(Wake up the victim of violence, shut the breath of the lifeless)
I'm chasing the righteous becoming a part of you

I'm breaking the silence; I'm falling down with you


Stay alive
Heaven holds a place for us tonight
I am paralyzed

Close your eyes
Drive away the cloud that hides the light
And leave the pain behind
Dead alive
Find a way to bury all the lies
Escape the pain inside
‘Cause I don't want to fall or let you go

Love left me hollow
I'm with you in the end
Cold, crippled and shallow
Don't leave me here again

Fruit of life
I can hear the voices of the hive
Chemicals collide
Loaded smile
Light the way for those you left behind
Set the earth on fire
‘Cause I don't want enough
I want it all

Love left me hollow
I'm with you in the end
Cold, crippled and shallow
Don't leave me here again
I can't go on
You are bound to break me in
I come undone
As you drag me down again

I come undone!

Love left me hollow
I'm with you in the end
Cold, crippled, and shallow
Don't leave me here again
I can't go on
You are bound to break me in
I come undone
As you drag me down again




Pain
Come alive
I try to breathe, shade my eyes
Follow the damned, I have lost the way again

Stay
Trust in life, carried beneath, dead arise
Sorrow avenged, I will face the weak within

So I'll stay unforgiven
And I'll keep love together
And I'll be yours forever
I'll sleep close to Heaven

Hate, lost inside
I dare to dream, faithless lies
Caught in the web, I will face the weak within

So I'll stay unforgiven
And I'll keep love together
And I'll be yours forever
I'll sleep close to Heaven

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Release me, my love

So I'll stay unforgiven
And I'll keep love together
And I'll be yours forever
I'll sleep close to Heaven

I'll sleep close to Heaven
I'll sleep close to Heaven





I keep falling out of line
I was drained and left behind
All will fade and petrify
Feed the hate and starve the lies

Falling in between
I am caught beneath

Light the way and let me go
Suffocate inside
I will break and watch you crawl
Bury me alive

I keep falling out of time
I was blamed and cauterized
All will change and calcify
Feed the hate and starve the lies

Falling in between
I am caught beneath

Light the way and let me go
Suffocate inside
I will break and watch you crawl
Bury me alive

Control

Lies inside
Lies inside

Light the way and let me go
Suffocate inside
I will break and watch you crawl
Bury me alive

Light the way and let me go
Suffocate inside
I will break and watch you crawl
Bury me alive
Bury me alive
Bury me alive
Carry me under, leave me abandoned
Show me what's left, show me what's left
Beautiful anger, breaking the pattern
Show me what's left, show me what's left

Take the color from your eyes
I bleed for you, I bleed for you
Bring the broken back to life
We'll make it through, we'll make it through

Empty and perfect, shattered and worthless
Show me what's left, show me what's left
Dragging me further, forget to remember
Show me what's left, show me what's left

Take the color from your eyes
I bleed for you, I bleed for you
Bring the broken back to life
We'll make it through, we'll make it through

Never again, never again
Time will not take the life from me
Never again, never again
Time will not take the life from me

And after this world is out of reach
Sober and silent, faded and violent
Hopeless I fight to fall between
Never surrender out of the embers
Save a space inside for me

Take the color from your eyes
I bleed for you, I bleed for you
Bring the broken back to life
We'll make it through, we'll make it through

Never again, never again
Time will not take the life from me
Never again, never again
Time will not take the life from me

Carry me all through the night
I am the last light fading
Leave all the lost souls behind
Show me the silence breaking
And when you're lost and out of time
I will be right here waiting
And when your dreams return to life
I'll be forever fading
And we'll fall behind

So I'll wait for you
As I keep your faith alive
And I'll pray for you
As we cross the great divide

Bury the wounds deep inside
Rupture the fault line breaking
Dream of the world left behind
Show us we're worth forsaking
And when the cold begins to rise
Darkness is overtaking
And when the fear is satisfied
I'll be forever changing
As we all arise

So I'll wait for you
As I keep your faith alive
And I'll pray for you
As we cross the great divide
And I'll break for you
As I open up the sky
And I'll stay for you
As we cross the great divide

Follow the sunlight down
Cry clear and loud
Heaven won't help us now
But it's better this way
Warm light wash me away

So I'll wait for you
As I keep your faith alive
And I'll pray for you
As we cross the great divide
And I'll break for you
As I open up the sky
And I'll stay for you
As we cross the great divide





Will the faithful be rewarded
When we come to the end
Will I miss the final warning
From the lie that I have lived
Is there anybody calling
I can see the soul within
And I am not worthy
I am not worthy of this

Are you with me after all
Why can't I hear you
Are you with me through it all
Then why can't I feel you

Stay with me, don't let me go
Because there's nothing left at all
Stay with me, don't let me go
Until the Ashes of Eden fall

Will the darkness fall upon me
When the air is growing thin
Will the light begin to pull me
To its everlasting will
I can hear the voices haunting
There is nothing left to fear
And I am still calling
I am still calling to you

Are you with me after all
Why can't I hear you
Are you with me through it all
Then why can't I feel you

Stay with me, don't let me go
Because there's nothing left at all
Stay with me, don't let me go
Until the Ashes of Eden fall

Don't let go

Why can't I hear you
Stay with me, don't let me go
Because there's nothing left at all
Stay with me, don't let me go
Until the Ashes of Eden fall
Heaven above me, take my hand (Stay with me, don't let me go)
Shine until there's nothing left but you
Heaven above me, take my hand (Stay with me, don't let me go)
Shine until there's nothing left but you

Slip away your vanity is gone
I'm falling out of place
We all fall down, the pain goes on
We bare the fruit of war
And turn the lost away
We all fall down, the pain goes on
And I'll be the fire that dries the flood

As I fight for one last prayer
I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the Devil down
I will stand alone
No longer defeated

Stripped away we rise above it all
Forgotten and betrayed
We all fall down, the pain goes on
No better than before
Still broken and afraid
We all fall down, the pain goes on
And I'll be the cloud that hides the sun

As I fight for one last prayer
I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the Devil down
I will stand alone
No longer defeated

I'm falling to pieces
Stained and used
I know what I need and it's not you
It's not you

As I fight for one last prayer
I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the Devil down
I will stand alone
No longer defeated
No longer defeated
No longer defeated



I can feel the animal within
I chain the beast and crawl inside myself
I hear the call of violence
I sleep no more and die again
I've lost it all

Carry me through this world alive
I feel no more, this suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf and shed my skin

I can see the devil closing in
I choke the breath that dies to cry for help
I feel the pull of gravity
I bleed no more and rise again
I've lost it all

Carry me through this world alive
I feel no more, this suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf and shed my skin

It is no longer a human, it's a beast
Unmerciful, ferocious, fearless
You're a madman
Tampering with nature
Every man, a vicious animal

Carry me through this world alive
I feel no more, this suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf and shed my skin

(Fight the animal)
Carry me through (fight the animal) this world alive
(Fight the animal)
I feel no more (fight the animal), this suffering
(Fight the animal)
Bury me in (fight the animal) this cold light
(Fight the animal)
I feed the wolf (fight the animal), and shed my skin



Days reborn
Fight with folded hands
Pain left below
The lifeless live again

Run, run, run
Red cold river
Run, run, run
Red cold river

I can't feel anything at all
This life has left me cold and damned
I can't feel anything at all
This love has led me to the end

Stay reformed
Erase this perfect world
Hate left below
The dark stray dog of war

Run, run, run
Red cold river

I can't feel anything at all
This life has left me cold and damned
I can't feel anything at all
This love has led me to the end

Try to find a reason to live
Try to find a reason to live
Try to find a reason to live

I can't feel anything at all
(Try to find a reason to live)
This life has left me cold and damned
(Try to find a reason to live)
I can't feel anything at all
This love has led me to the end

Run, run, run
Red cold river



Take this love!

I will make you
I will starve the pain within
I will crave you
I will learn to hate again
I will drain you
I will make you whole again
I will blame you
I will lay beside the dead

Cause I don't want to live inside this hell

Take the fire from within
You won't break me
Love will tie the tourniquet
And suffocate me

I won't save you
I won't starve the hope within
I won't change you
I won't fight the pain within
I won't fail you
I won't let your light descend
I won't play you
I won't face your fate again

Cause I am born to live inside this hell

Take the fire from within
You won't break me
Love will tie the tourniquet
And suffocate me

Take the fire from within
You won't take me
Love will tie the tourniquet
And suffocate me

Let the calm rise up
So graceful
Every wasted word
So faithful

Take the fire from within
You won't break me
Love will tie the tourniquet
And suffocate me

Take the fire from within
You won't take me
Love will tie the tourniquet
And suffocate me

Suffocate me
Suffocate me


Into the bottom I will go
I feel the daylight choking
Into the vile I've become
I am forever changing

In the cold eternal light
I am the ember fading
Every scar we try to hide
I am the fake you made me

Into the hollow I let go
I see the darkness close in
Into the silence I've become
I am the faith forsaken

In the cold eternal light
I am the ember fading
Every scar we try to hide
I am the fake you made me

Psycho, let go
I am the warm embracing
Psycho, faithful
I am the rupture breaking

In the cold eternal light
I am the ember fading
Every scar we try to hide
I am the fake you made me

Psycho, let go
I am the warm embracing
Psycho, faithful
I am the rupture breaking


It must have been inside my head
I've lost the hope that I have left
And now, at last, it comes to pass
We sleep, we dream, we have no less

Along the path we lost our way
It's all a game that I must play
And now the weak that fall
Return to ash, defeated after all

Fade away to the wicked world we left
And I become the dark of you
Say a prayer for the wounded heart within
As I become the dark of you

Let go, when all has come to life
We live, we breathe, we die
They call me to the light
Forever lost in time
With every dream we find
We feed, we burn, we lie
The fall of humankind
The everlasting light

Fade away to the wicked world we left
And I become the dark of you
Say a prayer for the wounded heart within
As I become the dark of you

Let go, when all has come to life
We live, we breathe, we die
They call me to the light
Forever lost in time
With every dream we find
We feed, we burn, we lie
The fall of humankind
The everlasting light

Fade away to the wicked world we left
And I become the dark of you
Say a prayer for the wounded heart within
As I become the dark of you

(Let go)
Save this selfish world
Save this selfish world
Save this selfish world
Save this selfish world

Lie beneath, faded and selfish
I fall between jaded and helpless
I long to breathe, wasted and empty inside
Defeat, faceless and buried alone

Into your eyes I live
Beautifully broken

Fight! We'll fight!
And bury our lives
We'll break these chains
And wash it away
Oh light
Carry me over the ground
Heavy won't hold me down

Blind, belief, wasted in envy
I long to bleed, nameless and hated
I fall relieved, violent and empty
Alive, deceit, suffer in silence alone

Into your eyes I live
Beautifully broken

Fight! We'll fight!
And bury our lives
We'll break these chains
And wash it away
Oh light
Carry me over the ground
Heavy won't hold me down

Lost, warm, light!
Tell me it's over, so long
Frail, dead, blind!
Under the shadow, hold on

Fight, we'll fight
And bury our lives
We'll break these chains
And wash it away
Carry me over the ground
Heavy won't hold me down
Into the sun we burn
Heavy won't hold me down!
Down!
Down!
Down!

Is this the way it's gotta be?
Ignite the fire inside of me
Embrace the life of tragedy
A tide of war and broken dreams

I am torn in two...
Hold on, hold on, we're barely alive
I am faded through...
Hold on, hold on, the fallen arise
I will fight this world for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life

Is this the fate we fall between?
Deface the life inside of me
Drain the heart with atrophy
And take away the remedy

I am torn in two...
Hold on, hold on, we're barely alive
I am faded through...
Hold on, hold on, the fallen arise
I will fight this world for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life!

(Please hold on...)
I am torn in two...
Hold on, hold on, we're barely alive
I am faded through...
Hold on, hold on, the fallen arise
I will fight this world for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life

Hold on
Rise!
Hold on
Rise!
Hold on
Rise!
Hold on


Every endless word
I have nothing here
Sick of all that was
Tired of all that is
Every hated love
I have broken in
Sick of fucking up
Tired of falling in

And all that I regret
I have before, I will again

It's over now (are you running away?)
I come apart (as I lie awake)
It's in my blood (let the sky fall down)
I won't let go (my oblivion)

Counting every breath
I am my own fear
Nothing ever was
Nothing ever is
Every halo lost
I am worn within
Nothing left to harm
Nothing left to live

And all that I regret
I have before, I will again

It's over now (are you running away?)
I come apart (as I lie awake)
It's in my blood (let the sky fall down)
I won't let go (my oblivion)

Face the monster I've become
(And fight! I will not become!)
In the ground we rise to burn
(Maybe your life will let me love!)
Forgive my heart

It's over now
I come apart
It's in my blood (let the sky fall down)
I won't let go (my oblivion)

Let forever take me in
Now I know that I'm alive
Give me something to forgive
As the wicked come to life
Show me where it all begins
As I watch this world divide
Hope will guide you to the end
And there will be no last goodbye

For all who live and die, leave it all behind

Take away the dark inside, and lead me to the light
All will fade before your eyes, as we turn the tide
I will bring the dream to life, hold on, just hold on
I will keep you here inside, just close your eyes

Take the rebel from within
Now I know that I'll survive
Show me how the lame pretend
As I watch this world collide
Fate will guide you to the end
And there will be no hope to hide

For all who live and die, leave it all behind

Take away the dark inside, and lead me to the light
All will fade before your eyes, as we turn the tide
I will bring the dream to life, hold on, just hold on
I will keep you here inside, just close your eyes

Leave it all behind

Take away the dark inside, and lead me to the light
All will fade before your eyes, as we turn the tide
I will bring the dream to life, hold on, just hold on
I will keep you here inside, hold on, just hold on
I will keep you here inside, just close your eyes



Lies are spoken
When the venom crawls inside
Faith is broken
When the fire fills our eyes
Love lies hopeless
When the hate becomes the high
Pain is chosen
When the devil comes alive

(Daylight falls)

So save yourself
I leave this world tonight
There's nothing left
I see the sun rise
My dying breath
I keep this prayer alive

Rain is closing
When you're caught between the lines
Faith is forfeit
When the hollow fills our eyes
Hate lies hopeless
When the heart and soul divide
Pain is worthless
When the shadow comes alive

(Daylight falls)

So save yourself
I leave this world tonight
There's nothing left
I see the sun rise
My dying breath
I keep this prayer alive

So save yourself
I leave this world tonight
There's nothing left
I see the sun rise
My dying breath
I keep this prayer alive


Hope start the heart
Last beat and lie
Cold walk the earth
Love faded white
Gave up the war
I realize
All will become
All will arise

Stay with me
I hear them call the tide
Take me in
I see the last divide
Hopelessly
I leave this soul behind
And I am paralyzed

When the broken fall alive
Let the light take me too
When the waters turn to fire
Heaven, please let me through
Far away, far away
Sorrow has left me here
Far away, far away
Let the light take me in

Fight back the flood
One breath of life
God, take the earth
Forever blind
And now the sun will fade
And all we are is all we made

Stay with me
I hear them call the tide
Take me in
I see the last divide
Hopelessly
I leave this soul behind
And I am paralyzed

When the broken fall alive
Let the light take me too
When the waters turn to fire
Heaven, please let me through
Far away, far away
Sorrow has left me here
Far away, far away
Let the light take me in

All will fall for once
I become the lost
All will fall for once
I become the lost

When the broken fall alive
Let the light take me too
When the waters turn to fire
Heaven, please let me through
Far away, far away
Sorrow has left me here
Far away, far away
Let the light take me in
Far away, far away
Let the light take me in
Far away, far away
Let the light take me in



You got me into this, I don't know when the tables will turn.
Coming around, it's something now, and I am known at the plate.
His only clue and I don't know it, only you can defer.
It'll only be assumedly, it's something you can a whirl!

Get out of my way!
Your name,
It's stuck in my way!
Always,
And now I'm far away.
Well that's alright, let's give this another try.

Tied in the innocence when we would, I don't need it, I don't want it alone.
You love to call it, I don't know it, I don't know anymore.
You listen, see, come and leave it I don't think you can bore.
There's something on it, I don't know it, I can't take anymore!

Get out of my way!
Your name,
It's stuck in my way!
Always,
And now I'm far away.
Well that's alright, let's give this another try.

Get out of my way!
Your name,
It's stuck in my way!
Always,
And now I'm far away.
Well that's alright, let's give this another try.

How long...?
What if...?
For your...?
It's on,
Anyone bother?
It's alright.
Okay,
Alone,
I don't
It's so pretty when,
That's all,
You want,
You bitch.
I live.
Oh so pretty when,
Suck up.
They're all,
This way,
I'll plan,
Your surrender!


You carry me places I'd rather be
Well mannered gardens well tempered seas
We're gathered in reason I should believe
That this is different that this isn't free
How could this be

I'm on my way to better days
I'll find my faith, I'll find a way
I'm on my way to better days
I'll find my faith

I will slip again, and you'll find me
I will live again, and you'll find me
Run, but carry the meanings of your past

I'm on my way to better days
You'll find your faith, you'll find a way
You're on your way to better days
You'll find your faith

Oh

I'm on our way to better days
We'll find our faith, we'll find a way

We're on our way to better days
We'll find our faith, we'll find a way
We're on our way to better days
We'll find our faith

I'm on my way
I'm on my way to better days
I'll find my way
We'll find our faith
Find our faith

Find our way
Our way
Find our way






They fall in line
One at a time
Ready to play
I can't see them anyway

No time to lose
We've got to move
Steady your helm
I am losing sight again

Fire your guns
It's time to run
Blow me away
I will stay in the mess I made

After the fall
We'll shake it off
Show me the way

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I am a shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

There's nothing left
So save your breath
Lying in wait
Caught inside this tidal wave

Your cover's blown
Nowhere to go
Holding your fate
Loaded I will walk alone

Fire your guns
It's time to run
Blow me away
I will stay in the mess I made

After the fall
We'll shake it off
Show me the way

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I am a shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

You wanted it back
Come fight me, God!
Here I come!
Fight!

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I am the shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

Save us all


Words like violence
Break the silence
They come crashing through
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand
Oh my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm


I feel you coming slow,
It seems that's all you know.
You come around never lie,
You sense it's all in line.
Deadened by the way you overwhelm,
Saved by the ways.
Dead and bothered by the breaking down,
Leave you all I have.
You might shove me down,
You will never be alone.
You can lock me out,
You will never be alone.
You can shove me down,
You will never be alone.
I don't know what you think,
You chose the silent way.
You look around you see,
It's just like all I believe.
Bothered by the part we end,
You will never leave again.
I'm a better part of you,
Dead if I can't make it out.
You might shove me down,
You will never be alone.
You can lock me out,
You will never be alone.
You can shove me down,
You will never be alone.
Your fucking way!
Bothered by the part we end,
You will never leave again.
I'm a better part of you,
It's all upon the end.
You can shove me down,
You will never be alone.
You can lock me out,
You will never be alone.
You can shove me down,
You will never be alone.
You can lock me out,
You will never be alone.


And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am


No Named Bars
Dead end Stars
Empty roads to Nowhere
Unlocked cars
Life's so far
There's no here to get there

As fast as I Run
Could you catch me for once
Its the last time
I learn my lesson the hard way

Because you lost
Because I just love to hate you
Because you lost me

Cold and clean
Perfect dream
I don't have or want them
Hand me down
White washed town
Another boring anthem

As fast as I run
Could you catch me for once
Its the last time
I learn my lesson the hard way

Because you lost
Because I just love to hate you
Because you lost me

You lost
You lie to me
You lie
You lie to me
You lied
You lie to me

As fast as I run
Could you catch me for once
Its the last time
I learn my lesson the hard way

Because you lost
Because I just love to hate you
Because you lost me

You lost
Because I just love to hate you
Because you lost me




There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams?
Yet slips away from us

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Ooh, Ooh

There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment
Set aside for us

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh
Who dares to love forever?
Oh, Oh, when love must die

Then touch my tears
With your lips
And touch my world
With your fingertips

And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today
Who waits forever anyway?



What did you say to me
I'm not a novelty
You're playing revelry
But no one's listening
I am a simple man
Without a simple plan
Let's make this easy
And just get out while we can

I'm the one you want

Hey Ladybug
You were always on the mind of everyone
Ladybug
You're pathetic and I've said it more than once
Ladybug
I believe you couldn't reach me where I am
Where my feet won't hit the ground

The time is passing by
You're my insecticide
The pressure's on the rise
And I'm right on time
Beautiful enemy
I'll fix your broken wings
And let you lie here until
You fly away from me

I'm the one you want

Hey Ladybug
You were always on the mind of everyone
Ladybug
You're pathetic and I've said it more than once
Ladybug
I believe you couldn't reach me where I am
Where my feet won't hit the ground

What did you say to me
I'm only here to clip your wings
You cut me down to size
I'm only living my life

Ladybug
You were always on the mind of everyone
Ladybug
You're pathetic and I've said it more than once
Ladybug
I believe you couldn't reach me where I am
Where my feet won't hit the ground
Where my feet won't hit the ground
Where my feet won't hit the ground
Where my feet won't hit the ground


Cast away all the enemies of yesterday
To alleviate all the memories that come our way
There's a better life now you know that I am on your side
Your beady eyes burn a hole right through the back of mine
I am out of time

[chorus:]
I'm an ordinary man
Like everybody else
Just a common counterfeit
I'm an ordinary man

Hesitate while the world is just a step away
To recreate all the innocence that time can take
I am wide awake
